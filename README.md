# Trion

**üî• Introducing TRION: The Vanguard of Fusion-Low Systems Languages**
*‚ÄúWhere pattern meets power.‚Äù*

---

## üß† OVERVIEW: WHAT IS TRION?

**Trion** is a next-generation **low-level** systems and networking language crafted for the age of **hyperconnectivity, cybersecurity fusion, and direct AI-embedded logic**. Inspired by **Ada**, **Fortran**, **C**, and **Python**, but recast into its own mythic syntax and paradigm matrix, Trion is not merely a language‚Äî**it is a full-spectrum programming philosophy**.

It targets both **WASM** and **native** (`.exe`, `.bin`, `.wasm`) using **LLVM**, but introduces its own **tight, squeezed, minimalistic Chicago‚ÄìSuperlative Hybrid grammar** with **leftward bias**, and offers native constructs for **packet optimization**, **quarantine memory**, **intrinsic threading**, **static multitasking**, and **capsule-based logic clusters**.

## üî• EXAMPLE: BASIC PROGRAM

```trion
Main ()
Print: hello world;
```

Same code could be expanded with capsule logic:

```trion
Capsule Greeter
    Init:
        message = "Hello Trion World"
        Print: message
EndCapsule
```

---

## üîÑ CONDITIONAL/CONTROL FLOW EXAMPLE

```trion
X = 1, y = 2

If x + y = 3
    While x + y > 0 then
        Print: possible ‚Äî therefore try
    Elseif x or y < 2
        Print: possible ‚Äî therefore try
    Elseif x + y < 4 and > 2
        Then Print: true, and therefore execute
    Else
        Print: false, ‚Äî and therefore fail
```

## üìö SAMPLE CAPSULE SNIPPET

```trion
Capsule Firewall
    Rule: Packet.source_ip = 127.0.0.1 then drop
    Rule: Packet.payload matches suspicious_pattern then isolate
    Rule: Packet.port = 22 then log "SSH access detected"
    Compile: optimize with quarantine-compression
EndCapsule
